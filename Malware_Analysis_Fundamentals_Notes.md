##Types of Malware:

### 1. Virus
### 2. Trojan
### 3. Worm
### 4. Backdoor
 - RAT: (Remote Access Trojan).
 - BOTNET: Network of hijacked Internet-connected computers.

### 5. Logic/Time Bombs
 - Piece of code inserted into computer software will execute a malicious function when a specified are met.

### 6. Ransomware
 - Crypto virology that threatens to publish the victim's data or block access to it (unless the ransome got paid).

### 7. Spyware
 - Transfer data from victim's computer to attacker's server.

### 8. Adware 
 - Transfer data from attacker's server to victim's computer.

### 9.Fileless Malware
 - Type of malware uses legitimate vulnerable program to infect the victim's computer by executing a malicious code directly within the memory instead of hard-dirve.
 - Anti-viruses can't easily detected this type of malware.

### 10. Advanced persistent Threat (APT)
 - state sponsered group remains undetected for extended period.
 1. RootKits:
  - Root: Runs in kernel-mode/Kit: Has more than one component.
  - Designed to hide the existence of certain processes from normal methods of detection.
  - e.g., Stuxnet, Flame
 2. BootKits:
  - BootKits -> Boot capability + RootKits
  - Are rootkits in which the first point of control is during the boot process.
  - Malicious Boot record can't just be deleted or moved without damaging the computer.

## Potentially-Unwanted Programs (PUPs):
 - Programs that may be unwanted, despite the possibility that users consented to download it.

## Steps of malware analysis:

### A. Basic Static analysis:
 - Confirm whether a file is malicious or not.
 - Provide info about the functionality.
 - Provide info to produce simpe network signatures.
 - Doesn't work with large complex malware.

### B. Basic Dynamic analysis:
 - Runnging the malware in safe ioslated lab.
 - Observing its behavior on the system.
 - Remove the infection and produce effective signatures.
 - Can be used without deep programming knowledge.
 - Not effective with all malware.

### C. Advanced Static analysis:
 - Load the executable into disassembler and looking at the program instructions.
 - It tells exactly what the malware does but It requires Knowledge of disassmebly, code constucts, Windows OS concepts and internals.
 - It takes much longer time that the basci analysis.

### D. Advanced Dynamic analysis:
 - Using a debugger to examine the internal  state of the malware while its running.
 - with ability to modify its execution path and state
 - Extract detailed info from the malicious executable.
